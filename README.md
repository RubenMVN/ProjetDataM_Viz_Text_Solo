# ProjetDataM_Viz_Text_Solo

Creation of a website with Streamlit for a Data Management, Visualization, and Text Mining project. The goal is to display a word cloud and a chart based on the retrieved data (in this case, a database of actions).

The first step is to unzip the data.csv.zip (or import the database using the import.py file). 

Then you need to install the required packages.

The article.py file is the method I used to scrap the article into the corpus.txt file.

The Test_wordloud.txt file is here to demonstrate the file upload function of the second page.
