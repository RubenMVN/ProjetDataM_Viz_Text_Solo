# ProjetDataM_Viz_Text
Creation of a website with Streamlit for a Data Management, Visualization, and Text Mining project. The goal is to display a word cloud and a chart based on the retrieved data (in this case, a database of actions).

The first step is to import the database using the import.py file (or unzip the data.csv.zip) and then replace [Your Path] in the Site.py file on line 9 to access the data.csv file located on your computer. 

Then you need to launch the Article.py file to create the corpus.text file and change the [Your Path] in the TextMining file on line 7 with the path to access the corpus.txt file located on your computer.
